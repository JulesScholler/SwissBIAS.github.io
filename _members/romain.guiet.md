BIOP: BioImaging & Optics Platform lead by [Arne Seitz](/members/arne.seitz/)

Romain has been working at the [BIOP](https://www.epfl.ch/research/facilities/ptbiop/) since 2011 after a Ph.D. in  Biology. He is responsible, along with [Olivier Burri](/members/olivier.burri/) and [Nicolas Chiaruttini](/members/nicolas.chiaruttini/), for the advice and follow up of student projects involving microscopy and quantification within the faculty of [Life Sciences at Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne](https://www.epfl.ch/schools/sv/). His expertise with *in vitro* cell culture and imaging is also beneficial to help users with their staining strategies and experiments optimization.

**Background:** Bioengineering, Ph.D. Immunology & Cancer (3D cell migration , organoid , cell-cytoskeleton)

**Current interests:** 
- Discovering new tools, using Deep Learning approaches to solve BIAs problem. 
- Teaching BioImage Analysis at [BIOP](https://www.epfl.ch/research/facilities/ptbiop/teaching/) and [NEUBIAS](http://eubias.org/NEUBIAS/training-schools/)
- Creating meaningful documentation for biologist, microscope users and BIAs [C4Science](https://c4science.ch/w/bioimaging_and_optics_platform_biop/)
- Preaching for reproducible workflow ([Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) & [ImageJ.JS](https://ij.imjoy.io/))

**Areas of expertise:**
- BioSample Preparation : *in vitro* cell, organoid, time-lapse, fixation, staining strategies, actin, mitochondria, fluorescent protein expression 
- BioImage Acquisition : Widefield, Confocal, Whole Slide Imaging, Super-resolution (SIM, STORM, STED), FRET, FRAP, FLIM
- BioImage Analysis: [Co-localization analysis](https://c4science.ch/w/bioimaging_and_optics_platform_biop/image-processing/colocalization/),[Deconvolution](https://c4science.ch/w/bioimaging_and_optics_platform_biop/image-processing/deconvolution/),   Time-lapse , Whole Slide Imaging

**Favorite BIA tools:** Fiji, ilastik, QuPath, Imaris, CellProfiler, OMERO, KNIME, ZENODO

**Languages:**
- *Human*: French, English, (Spanish, Arabic)
- *Program*: ImageJMacro, Groovy, Java, Python (Matlab, R)
