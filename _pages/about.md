The *Swiss BioImage Analysts's Society* is a network for and by bioimage analysts working in Switzerland.
Founded in early 2021 via Zoom, by 25 Swiss-based bioimage analysts.

This is a community effort driven by all members, with flexible degrees of involvement: 
If there is something you would like to see done, the fastest way may well be to just do it.

We purposefully run this as a shoe-string operation, with the declared goal of keeping adminstrative overhead minimal --- no newsletters, no board meetings, no reports.

If you want to join us as a member, just send an [email](mailto:info@swissbias.ch) and we will invite you.
There are currently no fees or charges involved in the running or joining of SwissBIAS.

# Purpose
- **Knowledge exchange**: Both technical and political
- **Collaborations**: Facilitating collaborations on projects
- **Teaching**: Sharing training material and organising events
- **Grant writing**: Collaborate on  grant applications
- **Visibility**: Define the role of bioimage analysts
