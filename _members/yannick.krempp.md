## About me

I work as technical manager and imaging expert at the **Cellular Imaging Facility**, Lausanne, Switzerland. My focus is on helping researchers to be able to analyze the data they acquire on our instruments.
If you're curious about the facility, head to [the CIF website](https://cif.unil.ch), that I'm also webmastering.
