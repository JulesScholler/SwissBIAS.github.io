SwissBIAS: The Swiss BioImage Analysts's Society.  
We are still building this site, so please bear with us.

---

## What this site contains
News about training schools, conferences, and network events.  
Links to relevant resources.  
A list of members.  

## What this site is *not* for
Online discussions about image analysis - pleae use the great [Scientific Community Image Forum ](https://forum.image.sc/) for that.  
Finding information about imaging - rather try the [MicroForum](https://forum.microlist.org/) for that.  

## The Wiki
The [wiki page](https://github.com/SwissBIAS/SwissBIAS.github.io/wiki) is for more technical information: How-to pages, recommendations of software to use for specific tasks (often the result of discussions within the network). Take a look and let us know if you want to contribute something.
