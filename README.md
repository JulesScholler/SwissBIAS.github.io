### First steps (hello world and README)
- Following instructions on https://pages.github.com/
- Editing files/repo locally and using a terminal as git client, do
  + git add --all
  + git commit -m "Initial commit"
  + git push -u origin main
- Editing files/repo locally and using the GitHub desktop git client (mac or win), do
  + click "commit to main"
  + click "push"
- Editing files on GitHub, do
  + click "Commit change" at bottom of change

### Next steps (Jekyll)
- Read here https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll
- Seems like it may be necessary to install Jekyll on local machine
- Look into cloning setup directly though, from GitHub
