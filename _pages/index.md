The *Swiss BioImage Analysts' Society* is a network for and by bioimage analysts working in Switzerland. It was founded in early 2021 during a video-conference, by an initial group of 25 participants.

This is a community effort driven by all members, with flexible degrees of involvement: 
If there is something you would like to see done, the fastest way may well be to just do it.

We purposefully run this as a shoe-string operation, with the declared goal of keeping administrative overhead minimal --- no newsletters, no board meetings, no reports.


## Why this society exists
Its members seek synergies on the following points:
- **Knowledge exchange**: Both technical and political
- **Collaborations**: Facilitating collaborations on projects
- **Teaching**: Sharing training material and organising events
- **Grant writing**: Collaborate on grant applications
- **Visibility**: Define the role of bioimage analysts


## Who this is for and how to join
The target group is people working in Switzerland that self-identify as bioimage analysts: This includes facility and technical staff, group leaders, postdocs, and students from universities as well as industry. 
If you are interested, [email](mailto:info@swissbias.ch) us, and we will invite you to join our SLACK workspace and monthly Zoom meetings.
