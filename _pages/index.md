*You guessed it, this site is under development (2021-03-04)*

---

## What this site contains
A list of Swiss groups and facilities working with bioimage analysis  
News about training schools, conferences, and network events  
Links to relevant resources

## What this site is *not* for
Asking questions about image analysis - use the [Scientific Community Image Forum ](https://forum.image.sc/) for that  
Finding information about microscopy - unless coupled to image analysis

## The Wiki
The [wiki page](https://github.com/SwissBIAS/SwissBIAS.github.io/wiki) is for more technical information: How-to pages, recommendations of software to use for specific tasks (often the result of discussions within the network). Take a look and let us know if you want to contribute something.
